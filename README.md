multirecorder
=============

A library for recording multiple sounds from your mic, deleting them, and combining them together.

This library is based heavily on https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs, and is mostly a modification for my 
specific use case of combining multiple recordings. There's also a rewrite of how the Web Worker communication works
to make it easier to call multiple functions simultaneously.
