multirecorder
=============

A library for recording multiple sounds from your mic, deleting them, and combining them together.

This library is based heavily on https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs, and is mostly a modification for my specific use case of combining multiple recordings. There's also a rewrite of how the Web Worker communication works to make it easier to call multiple functions simultaneously.

Usage
=============

    var multirecorder = new MultiRecorder()

    multirecorder.startRecording()
    multirecorder.stopRecording()
    multirecorder.isRecording()
    multirecorder.combineRecordings(recordings)

Many of these methods will return Deferreds, which will resolve and pass a Recorder object as an argument. You can then store those objects for later use (like to combine), and call methods like
createAudioPlayer and createDownloadLink.
